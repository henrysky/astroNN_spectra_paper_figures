Abstract
===========

Deep learning with artificial neural networks is increasingly gaining attention, because of its potential for data-driven
astronomy. However, this methodology usually does not provide uncertainties and does not deal with incompleteness and
noise in the training data. In this work, we design a neural network for high-resolution spectroscopic analysis using
APOGEE data that mimics the methodology of standard spectroscopic analyses: stellar parameters are determined using the
full wavelength range, but individual element abundances use censored portions of the spectrum. We train this network
with a customized objective function that deals with incomplete and noisy training data and apply dropout variational
inference to derive uncertainties on our predictions. We determine parameters and abundances for 18 individual elements
at the â‰ˆ0.03dex level, even at low signal-to-noise ratio. We demonstrate that the uncertainties returned by our method
are a realistic estimate of the precision and they automatically blow up when inputs or outputs outside of the training
set are encountered, thus shielding users from unwanted extrapolation. By using standard deep-learning tools for GPU
acceleration, our method is extremely fast, allowing analysis of the entire APOGEE data set in ten minutes on a single,
low-cost GPU. We release the stellar parameters and 18 individual-element abundances with associated uncertainty for the
entire APOGEE DR14 dataset. Simultaneously, we release ``astroNN``, a well-tested, open-source python package
developed for this work, but that is also designed to be a general package for deep learning in astronomy. ``astroNN`` is
available at https://github.com/henrysky/astroNN with extensive documentation at http://astroNN.readthedocs.io.

Getting Started
=================

This repository is to make sure all figures and results are reproducible by anyone easily for this paper [`arXiv:1804.08622`_][`ADS`_].

.. _arXiv:1804.08622: https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.04428
.. _ADS: https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019MNRAS.483.3255L/abstract

If Github has issue (or too slow) to load the Jupyter Notebooks, you can go
http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/henrysky/astroNN_spectra_paper_figures/tree/master/

To get started, this paper uses `astroNN`_ developed by us and tested with **astroNN 1.0.0** which Python 3.6 or above
and reasonable computational resource is required. Extensive documentation of v1.0.0 at
https://astronn.readthedocs.io/en/v1.0.0/ and quick start guide at https://astronn.readthedocs.io/en/v1.0.0/quick_start.html.
astroNN Apogee DR14 Stellar Parameters and Abundances data is available as `astroNN_apogee_dr14_catalog.fits`_.

Some notebooks make use of my `milkyway_plot`_ to plot on milkyway.

To continuum normalize arbitrary APOGEE spectrum with v1.0.0, see: https://astronn.readthedocs.io/en/v1.0.0/tools_apogee.html#continuum-normalization-of-apogee-spectra

Docker Image
----------------

If you have `Docker`_ installed, you can use the `Dockerfile`_ to build a Docker image upon Pytorch container from `NVIDIA NGC Catalog`_ with all dependencies installed and data files downloaded.

.. _NVIDIA NGC Catalog: https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/containers/pytorch
.. _Dockerfile: Dockerfile
.. _Docker: https://www.docker.com/

To build the Docker image called ``astronn_spectra_paper_figures``, run the following command in the root directory of this repository:

.. code-block:: bash

    docker build -t astronn_spectra_paper_figures .

To run the Docker container with all GPU available to the container named ``testing123``, run the following command:

.. code-block:: bash
    
    docker run --gpus all --name testing123 -it -e SHELL=/bin/bash --entrypoint bash astronn_spectra_paper_figures

Then you can attach to the container by running:

.. code-block:: bash

    docker exec -it testing123 bash

Now you can run all notebooks or training script inside the container

    # the same spectrum used in figure 5
    opened_fits = fits.open(visit_spectra(dr=14, apogee='2M19060637+4717296'))
    spectrum = opened_fits[1].data
    spectrum_err = opened_fits[2].data
    spectrum_bitmask = opened_fits[3].data

    # using default continuum and bitmask values to continuum normalize
    norm_spec, norm_spec_err = apogee_continuum(spectrum, spectrum_err,
                                                bitmask=spectrum_bitmask, dr=14)

    # load neural net
    neuralnet = load_folder('astroNN_0617_run001')

    # inference, if there are multiple visits, then you should use the globally
    # weighted combined spectra (i.e. the second row)
    pred, pred_err = neuralnet.test(norm_spec)

    print(neuralnet.targetname)  # output neurons representation

    Note (1): After DR10 was published we discovered that four stars had double
              entries with identical numbers in this table (those are deleted from
              this table, thus providing 559 stars). All calibration equations were
              derived with those four double entries in our tables, but because
              DR10 is already published we decided not to change the fitting
              equations in this paper. This problem does not affect the effective
              temperature correction.  The changes in the other fitting equations
              are completely negligible and have no affect in any scientific
              application.  The parameters published in DR10 are off by <1 K in
              case of the effective temperature error correction, and by < 0.001 dex
              for the metallicity, metallicity error, and surface gravity
              correction.
